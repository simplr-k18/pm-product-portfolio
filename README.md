# Product Thinking Portfolio by Rishi

This is a collection of product insights, pain point explorations, and PM-style solutions across popular digital products

Each folder contains:
- 🔍 Real user pain points
- 💡 Product rationale and tradeoffs
- 📊 Success metrics
- 🧪 Optional prototypes/code

> I'm not a PM by title, but this is how I think, design, and build as one.

## Case Studies
will update soon
